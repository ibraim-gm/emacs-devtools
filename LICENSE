Emacs-DevTools use a multitude of libraries to deliver its functionality. The
list is always growing, and while it's not practical to put the name of every
library and every developer involved with it here, I still like to thanks all of
the emacs community for it's attentionand for sharing so much high-quality
code. Without it, this project wouldn't be possible.

Thank you.
